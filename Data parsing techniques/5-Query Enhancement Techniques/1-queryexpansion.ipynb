    "\n",
    "In a RAG pipeline, the quality of the query sent to the retriever determines how good the retrieved context is — and therefore, how accurate the LLM’s final answer will be.\n",

    "#### 🎯 What is Query Enhancement?\n",
    "Query enhancement refers to techniques used to improve or reformulate the user query to retrieve better, more relevant documents from the knowledge base.\n",
    "It is especially useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The original query is short, ambiguous, or under-specified\n",
    "- You want to broaden the scope to catch synonyms, related phrases, or spelling variants"

      " CrewAI agents are semi-autonomous, role-specialized AI “workers” that team up in a predefined workflow to tackle complex, multi-step tasks.  Key points:  \n",

      "   • Researcher – gathers data and insights  \n",
      "   • Planner – lays out strategy, timelines, and dependencies  \n",
      "   • Executor – carries out concrete actions (e.g. drafting text, writing code, running analyses)  \n",
      "   • Reviewer/Validator – checks quality and flags issues  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Structured Collaboration  \n",
      "   • Unlike solitary autonomous agents, CrewAI’s agents pass work products and feedback along a chain of responsibility, ensuring each subtask is handled by the most appropriate specialist.  \n",
      "   • Communication channels and hand-off protocols are built into the system, so progress and context flow smoothly from one agent to the next.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use Cases  \n",
      "   • Market Research – one agent mines data, another synthesizes findings, a third writes the report.  \n",
      "   • Legal Document Analysis – a specialist agent extracts clauses, another summarizes risks, a reviewer validates accuracy.  \n",
      "   • Product Development – ideation, prototyping, testing, documentation handled by distinct agents.  \n",
      "   • Coding Assistance – design, implementation, debugging, and code review split across agents.  \n",
      "\n",
      "By combining specialization (each agent does what it does best) with a clear, collaborative workflow, CrewAI agents can handle end-to-end, multi-stage tasks more efficiently and reliably than lone AI assistants.\n"
