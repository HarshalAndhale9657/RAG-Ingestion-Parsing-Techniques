    "### Chatbot And RAG Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant external knowledge. It has become one of the most widely used approaches for building LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to evaluate your RAG applications using LangSmith. You'll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to create test datasets\n",
    "2. How to run your RAG application on those datasets\n",
    "3. How to measure your application's performance using different evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "A typical RAG evaluation workflow consists of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a dataset with questions and their expected answers\n",
    "2. Running your RAG application on those questions\n",
    "3. Using evaluators to measure how well your application performed, looking at factors like:\n",
    " - Answer relevance\n",
    " - Answer accuracy\n",
    " - Retrieval quality\n",
    " \n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll create and evaluate a bot that answers questions about a few of Lilian Weng's insightful blog posts."

       "{'answer': '<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking \"What is agents\". Let me check the provided documents to find the answer.\\n\\nLooking at the documents, there\\'s a blog post by Lilian Weng titled \"LLM-powered Autonomous Agents\". The overview mentions that in such a system, the LLM acts as the agent\\'s brain, with components like planning, memory, and tool use. The agents break down tasks into subgoals, use self-reflection, and have different types of memory. Also, examples like AutoGPT and BabyAGI are given.\\n\\nSo, the answer should explain that agents here are autonomous systems powered by LLMs, capable of planning, using memory, and tools. Need to keep it concise, three sentences max. Make sure to mention the core components and examples from the documents.\\n</think>\\n\\nLLM-powered autonomous agents are systems where a large language model (LLM) acts as the core controller, enabling tasks like planning, memory management, and tool use. These agents break down complex tasks into subgoals, reflect on past actions, and adapt using memory and environmental observations. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI, which demonstrate their potential as general problem solvers.',\n",
