📚 RAG Ingestion & Parsing Techniques
🚀 Overview

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an approach that combines retrieval from a knowledge base with generative language models to produce accurate, contextually grounded responses.
This repository explores data ingestion and parsing techniques essential for building robust RAG systems — focusing on turning raw documents into retrievable chunks that empower meaningful retrieval and generation.

This project demonstrates ingestion and parsing workflows that prepare diverse textual data for downstream RAG applications

🔍 Key Features

✔️ Document ingestion pipeline
✔️ Text extraction & parsing methods
✔️ Chunking and prepared data for vector storage
✔️ Extensible examples to integrate with embeddings/vector DBs

🧠 Why Ingestion & Parsing Matter

Before a RAG system can retrieve relevant knowledge, it must transform raw data (PDFs, text files, scraped content, etc.) into meaningful, semantically searchable representations:

Ingestion loads the raw content.

Parsing extracts structured text and metadata from it.

Chunking splits large documents into manageable units.

Embedding & storage turns text chunks into vectors for retrieval.
